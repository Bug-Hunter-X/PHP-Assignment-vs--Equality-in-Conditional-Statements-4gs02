This code suffers from a common PHP error: using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) inside an if condition.  This results in unexpected behavior because the assignment always evaluates to true, except when assigning false.

```php
<?php
$a = 5;
if ($a = 10) {
    echo "a is 10";
} else {
    echo "a is not 10";
}
?>
```
